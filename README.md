# Compileher Quiz Application
                   This is a Simple Quiz Application with 3 Sets of Questions, each set of questions for 2 slots and 
      both the slots have the same questions but shuffled . The user will not be able to use right click and 
      the refresh function refreshes the whole page (ie) the user has to log in again then attend the quiz but
      re entry of the registration for the second time fails because the user will be already 
      registered in the database ultimately failing the attempt of the user who tries to cheat.
      This also contains a set only for the final quiz and the final quiz has only single set.
